# Micro-for-Computer-Science---Nash-Equilbirium

## Nash Equilibrium Solver for Finite Two-Person Games
This Python script calculates the pure strategy Nash equilibria for finite two-person games using randomly generated payoff matrices. This is a fundamental concept in game theory, useful in various strategic decision-making scenarios where two players simultaneously choose strategies and receive payoffs based on the combination of choices.

### Prerequisities
To run this script, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine along with the NumPy library, which is used for numerical operations. You can install NumPy using pip if it's not already installed:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

### How to run the script
1. **Clone or download the script:** First, make sure that you have the script saved on your local machine.
2. **Open a terminal or command prompt:** Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. **Run the script:** Execute the script by typing python nash_equilibrium_solver.py in your terminal or command prompt.

### Modifying the Script
- To change the size of the game (number of strategies), modify the n variable.
- To test specific payoff matrices, replace the random generation with static values.
